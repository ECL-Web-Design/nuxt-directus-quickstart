# Server Site Scripts

Generic helper scripts to help with automating tedious tasks, currently only `make-cert` exists for automating https
certifications

Planning to add scripts to help with nginx and directus setups

To allow the `script-manager` cmd to be accessed globally on the server, simply run `sudo npm install script-manager -g`
on the server while the cmd line is located in the scripts folder.
