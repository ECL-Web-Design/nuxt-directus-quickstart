# Directus Extensions Config

Make sure extension files and folder trees are giving full permissions for directus user, otherwise they will not be
found by directus

# Currently Installed

The two plugins currently installed help with schema management and typescript generation for the client api consumer.

Typescript generation will hopefully be replaced by the official directus solution soon.

Enable these modules in Project Settings/Modules. If they are not there make sure your priorities are set appropriately
on the extension files and folders.
